# Log

Dated entries by either agent: what was done, what was found, what could not be done.

## 2026-09-13 (Claude)
- Initial public release; docs/ASTRA_TODO.md written for the second agent.

## 2026-09-13 (Astra, A1 — Epoch inventory)
- Worked in a separate clone of recozers/openobservatory, branch `astra/a1-epoch-inventory`. The original workspace points to recozers/Meridian and was left untouched; no Claude research files were changed.
- Accounted for all 86 Epoch records: seven existing curated matches, 78 new sites with 264 hall polygons, and one location-only record (Stargate New Mexico, capacity unassigned/tier U because no polygon is available). There are 103 non-control public status entries.
- The brief missed the public Epoch map's explicit Building annotations and coordinates (85/86 sites). Preserved a CC BY 4.0 source snapshot and used those annotations instead of treating large nearby OSM buildings as halls. Geocoding is cached, serial and rate-limited: 23 new entries have corroborated address-quality coordinates; 56 use Epoch's published coordinates. No hall polygons overlap another inventory site's halls by more than 10% of the smaller polygon.
- Preserved 996 normalized dated capacity rows across both bases. `it_reported` is not measured HPL power; facility and IT figures are not added together. Zero, missing and future projections remain distinct. Existing validated labels are retained for the seven curated matches.
- Completed independent Sentinel-2 extraction from 2018 for all 78 new polygon sites. Accepted event dates occur at 71 sites / 217 halls; 13 halls are left-censored at the first observations; 34 are unresolved. Of those unresolved, 16 brightness candidates conflict with Epoch's reported construction timing and are retained as raw evidence but withheld from public roof dates pending imagery review. The original twelve Abilene dates do not change.
- Geometry judgement calls: 17 source line outlines were closed with endpoint gaps under 5 m; two self-intersections were repaired with Shapely make_valid. All 19 carry low confidence and explicit repair notes; source geometries remain in the snapshot. Planned annotations are not treated as existing roofs.
- Withdrew unsupported Epoch MW from the three provisional Chinese park polygons: published Huawei Horinger, Alibaba Zhangbei and VNET Bayin locations lie approximately 2.0, 1.8 and 15.4 km from those old park centroids. They are separate sourced entries; the old research polygons/adjacent-plant series remain, with capacity tier U.
- Validation: 12 unittest cases pass; all 218 generated JSON files strictly parse; all three site builds pass; deterministic import reproduces inventory/polygon files byte-for-byte. Desktop and 390 px mobile map panels were visually checked locally. The lower request-size limit and bounded retries recovered three Earth Engine concurrent-aggregation failures.
- Review `docs/epoch_inventory_audit.md`, `data/epoch/validation.json`, `data/epoch/import_audit.csv`, and `tools/ingest_epoch.py` first. These are automated brightness-based dates with stated limitations, not independent proof of IT utilisation. A3's dark-roof method remains separate research.
## 2026-09-13 evening (Claude): pilot results
- Winter snow persistence (tools/snow_persistence.py, Sentinel-2 SCL/NDSI, nine sites, winters 2019-2026): NEGATIVE.
  On days when the built-up ring is >= 40 % snow-covered, operating halls hold snow like any other roof:
  Lulea halls 0.97-1.00 vs ring 0.97-1.00 (15-23 snow days per winter); NSA Utah 1.0 every winter; Rainier operating
  winters 2025-26 0.97-1.00 while the control factory roof sheds to 0.33-0.84; Chinese campuses equal to the ring.
  The only low values are construction winters (Rainier 2024: 0.00-0.32 with roofs not yet on; Prometheus LCO 2024).
  Consistent with the thermal null: hall roofs are cold roofs. Closed; results in results_snow/.
- Sentinel-1 VV structure-on dates (tools/s1_timeline.py): at Abilene all 12 halls within 0-4 months of the Sentinel-2
  roof dates (9 within 2); Hyperion farmland gives no false positive with the rule "VV >= 4 dB above the 20th
  percentile of earlier months, sustained 6 months". Chinese blocks that Sentinel-2 could only label "existing"
  (bright soil baseline) get dates: Ulanqab long_halls 2024-09 (S2 said 2025-11: grey roof missed), Horinger block_a
  2024-06, block_b 2019-06, Zhangbei west_halls 2020-01.
- VIIRS night lights (tools/ntl_timeline.py): Abilene campus-minus-annulus flat at -9 nW/cm2/sr 2019-2024, lit from
  2024-12 (six months after ground-breaking), rising to +120 by 2026 as build-out continued; Colossus 1 step 2025-01.
  Lights track construction and site expansion, not the operating date (Colossus IT load began 2024-07).
- Operator disclosures (two research agents, 13 Sep evening): Meta per-site annual electricity 2011-2024 for Prineville,
  Lulea, New Albany (data/operator_disclosures.csv, 138 rows with URLs); ORNL Frontier measured energy; Google per-site PUE
  and water only; Microsoft by metro from FY25; Amazon nothing. Chinese listed operators: company-wide MW and utilisation only
  (VNET 70-74 %, GDS 75 %, Chindata 80 % in 2023); no per-campus figures except Chindata's FY2022 20-F table (unparsed, task A10).
  Site build now: measured annual rows take precedence (band ±10 %), cloud utilisation prior 0.2-0.6, HPC 0.4-0.9.
- Radar-to-optical chain at Horinger (13 Sep, late): the 27 radar candidates >= 5 ha were run through the Sentinel-2
  brightness timeline (results_s2/horinger_candidates.csv). Only 4 of 27 get an optical roof date (cand03 2024-05, cand16
  2026-05, cand19 2022-05, cand24 2025-04); the rest stay at 0.17-0.25 brightness, i.e. grey roofs over bright soil, the
  known failure of the brightness rule (Astra task A3). In Inner Mongolia the radar date stands alone; the chip is the
  human check. tools/s2_roof_timeline.py now chunks queries by quarter/month for large polygon sets (5000-feature cap).

### 2026-09-13 — Astra A2 provincial filing audit

Searched provincial EPB/NDRC sources for three provisional campuses and seven hub centroids. Two downloaded EIAs were text-extracted and relevant pages visually checked: Huawei south-area substation (3 x 100 MVA, separate parcel) and VNET supply lines (110 kV; terminal near A1 Epoch coordinates, about 15 km from the old park). No IT-load MW can be assigned to the existing halls. Kept infrastructure units, coordinates, URLs, PDF hashes and search leads in data/china_project_documents.json; all ten inventory rows receive a dated note. No unsupported number or invented campus boundary was promoted. docs/china_project_search.md records scope and limitations; A2 satisfies the explicit negative-search alternative.
### 2026-09-13 — Astra A1 integration with current main

Integrated Claude commits through 14e24f0: retained operator annual-load priority, utilisation priors, radar dates and night-light evidence. Regenerated the Epoch inventory on the updated CSV schemas and rebuilt all public JSON. The S2 extraction conflict keeps Astra’s cached adaptive date splitting (1,000-feature target), which covers Claude’s large-polygon batching fix as well. Brightness review flags and unknown dates remain explicit.
