Dated entries by either agent: what was done, what was found, what could not be done.

## 2026-09-13 (Claude)
- Initial public release; docs/ASTRA_TODO.md written for the second agent.

## 2026-09-13 (Astra, A6 — monthly refresh)
- Added service-account authentication from `EE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` or a local key path; CI never launches interactive authentication. Existing local OAuth remains supported. Five credential tests pass.
- Added monthly/manual refresh and a PR dry-run. Local dry-run rebuilt and strictly parsed 60 JSON files without Earth Engine credentials. Live runs commit only site data and explicitly dispatch Pages (a GITHUB_TOKEN push does not trigger another push workflow).
- Recorded the five published flux profile mappings. The undocumented Colossus 2 seasonal baseline was recovered as before 2025-07-01: reproduces every existing monthly NOx value to the 0.05 kg/h CSV rounding tolerance. Other plant mappings reproduce existing series. Raw research profiles stay research inputs.
- Pinned earthengine-api 1.7.43, tabulate 0.10.0 and openpyxl 3.1.5 to the installed versions; scipy was already pinned.
- Service-account live extraction is not yet validated on GitHub: Stuart must configure the documented secrets. New daily NOx profiles are not downloaded by this workflow. The derived series are recomputed from saved profiles.
- GitHub validation: both the PR dry-run and an actual `workflow_dispatch` dry-run passed; dispatch run https://github.com/recozers/openobservatory/actions/runs/34760217886. A6 acceptance criteria met (PR #1).
